How to add a mis-detected license
---------------------------------

Known licenses are stored in
``src/licensename/known_licenses.py``. The structure is aimed to be
understandable by humans: it's a simple dict, each level of the dict
correspond to an unwrapped paragraph in the license, like::

    "APPLE PUBLIC SOURCE LICENSE": {
        "Version 1.0 - March 16, 1999": "APSL-1.0",
        "Version 1.1 - April 19,1999": "APSL-1.1",
        "Version 2.0 - August 6, 2003": "APSL-2.0"
    },
    "Academic Free License": {
        "Version 1.1": "AFL-1.1",
        "Version 1.2": "AFL-1.2"
    }

reads like: If first paragraph one is "APPLE PUBLIC SOURCE LICENSE",
and the second paragraph is "Version 1.0 - March 16, 1999", it's an
"APSL-1.0" license.

In other worlds, first dict is for paragraph one, second level of dicts are
for paragraph two, etcâ€¦ until as string is found instead of a dict, meaning
there's no longer need for disambiguation, and it's the license name.

Lines containing ``(c)``, ``(C)``, empty lines, or starting with
``Copyright`` are removed before paragraph parsing.

You can easily see how ``licensename`` sees paragraphs of a license
file by trying the ``--pretty-print`` option::

    $ licensename --pretty-print tests/licenses/MIT~1.txt
